# Facial_Emotion_Recognition

## Objective
• Developed a Deep Learning model to classify 7 human emotions using Data Augmentation on CK+48(Kaggle) dataset.

• Sequential model having a Convolutional Neural Network layer with max polling and activation was used for training the dataset.
• Successfully classified the images and obtained a validation accuracy of 93.7%, and applied callbacks to prevent overfitting.

## Approach
The project utilized the CK+48 dataset from Kaggle, which consisted of facial images representing seven different human emotions. To enhance the dataset and improve model performance, Data Augmentation techniques were employed. A Sequential model with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layer, along with max pooling and activation functions, was constructed for training the dataset. Callbacks were implemented to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance.

## Outcome
The project successfully classified facial images into 7 different emotions and achieved a validation accuracy of 93.7%, indicating its effectiveness in recognizing emotions accurately.
Overall, the project demonstrated the potential of Deep Learning models for facial emotion recognition and their ability to achieve high accuracy in classifying human emotions.
