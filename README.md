# Facial_Emotion_Recognition

## Objective
The objective was to develop a Deep Learning model for facial emotion recognition using a dataset containing images of different emotions.

## Approach
The project utilized the CK+48 dataset from Kaggle, which consisted of facial images representing seven different human emotions. 
To enhance the dataset and improve model performance, Data Augmentation techniques were used.

A Sequential model with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layer, along with max pooling and activation functions, was constructed for training the dataset. Callbacks were implemented to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance.

## Outcome
The project successfully classified facial images into 7 different emotions and achieved a validation accuracy of 93.7%, indicating its effectiveness in recognizing emotions accurately.

Overall, the project demonstrated the potential of Deep Learning models for facial emotion recognition and their ability to achieve high accuracy in classifying human emotions.
